# Speed-tracker-MPU6050

This project intends to develop a low-cost solution to underwater speed tracking.

Using an Atmega328 and an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope, we are trying to find a way do get the acceleration data from the MPU
and integrate it in such a way that approximates the instant velocity of a swimmer with respect to time.

The data are exported to a SD card.
